# ltchat
Qt GUI front-end to the Lightron.org chat.

The Qt5 ltchat is the main focus; Qt4 ltchat development may lag behind.

## Installing
This requires Python2 to run. It also requires several libraries: httplib, urllib. If you wish to run the Qt5 GUI (recommended), it requires PyQt5. Qt4 requires PyQt4 or PySide to run.
### Debian or Ubuntu based systems
You can install all this in one line: `sudo apt-get install python python-pyqt5 python-urllib3 python-httplib2`
